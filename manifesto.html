         Imagine yourself walking into a forest. You struggle through the untamed branches and vines, unsure of where you are or where you're going. You feel like you've been walking for hours, but you can't see any indication of how far you still have to go, so you soon feel yourself growing tired and frustrated. 
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          Now imagine yourself again walking into the same forest, but this time the entrance feels inviting, and a trail has already been cleared ahead of you. As you walk, signs along the path draw your attention to the most interesting features of the forest.

          Which experience felt more rewarding to you? The one where you were thrown into new environment with no idea what to expect, or the one where every detail was designed for your comfort?

        <section class="step">
          This level of hospitality and consideration is what good writers should strive to do for their readers. By writing, you invite the reader into your space. <br></br> Here are some steps you can take to treat your audience like a houseguest:
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="header">1. Roll Out the Welcome Mat</div>
          To create an approachable space for your reader, you must first invite them in! Let your reader know all the fascinating things waiting for them inside, and make your case for why this is worth the effort.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="header">2. Be Patient</div>
          Keep in mind — even though <i>you</i> may already know your way around, your guest has never been here before! So make sure to be their guide as they explore these unfamiliar surroundings, and try to keep yourself from assuming that they know what you know.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          This means that you need to:
          <ol type="I">
          <li>signpost where you're going to go beforehand</li>
          <li>explain thoroughly once you're there</li>
          <li>refer back continuously to give your reader a sense of how it all connects</li>
          <li>reiterate the most important points at the very end just in case</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="header">3. Anticipate Their Needs</div>
          You may not be able to physically speak with the reader, but as the reader absorbs your ideas, they will naturally respond with questions and comments of their own. Since there's no way to hear and respond to what they say in the moment, your job as a writer is to anticipate and address those concerns ahead of time.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="header">4. Share Your Space</div>
          Lastly, remember that communicating means nothing without someone else there to respond to your ideas. Writing is, above all, a dialogue and a sharing of ideas between writer and reader. <br></br>When your reader finds their own home within your space, you will find that space changing for the better — expanding to fit the world within it.
