        <section class="step">
         Imagine yourself walking into a forest. You struggle through the untamed branches and vines, unsure of where you are or where you're going. You feel like you've been walking for hours, but you can't see any indication of how far you still have to go, so you soon feel yourself growing tired and frustrated. 
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          Now imagine yourself again walking into the same forest, but this time the entrance feels inviting, and a trail has already been cleared ahead of you. As you walk, signs along the path draw your attention to the most interesting features of the forest. 
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          Which experience felt more rewarding to you? The one where you were thrown into new environment with no idea what to expect, or the one where every detail was designed for your comfort? 
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">My Stumbles</div>
          And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
          I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
          I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
          Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
          My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.
        </section>
        <section class="step">
          <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
          The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
